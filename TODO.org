GitLab's ORG support is half-baked. Do not view this file there. Get Emacs.

** TODO OSX build: https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/7
*** also need builds for any platform, really.
** DONE text replacements / unicode translations: https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/15 ; https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/19 ; https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/21
** PROGRESS alt+backspace => delete word: https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/18
** DONE cli for database: sort of https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/23
*** PROGRESS needs (more) documentation
*** TODO improve this to actual profiles: more user friendly
** CANCELLED pause mode: https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/2
think this is more hassle than worth
** TODO text navigation: https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/4

This one would be nice to implement.

** RTL language support: https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/9

Hmm, how do I do testing on this one? I have no idea when/if RTL looks right or not?

** random Wikipedia articles: https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/16

cool blingy feature but possibly too much hassle. would add several new dependencies.

** DONE make native default: https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/17
** DONE CSS theme support
*** TODO make a "large text" normal/dark theme?
*** https://github.com/sommerc/pyqt-stylesheets/tree/master/pyqtcss/src/dark_blue and https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html
** TODO make interaction with source texts better (easier/more intuitive delete, preview, et cetera)

Has been suggested from a few different sources.

** texts per day display: https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/20
** Bug? Why is welcome shown for non-empty db? https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype/issues/22
Haven't seen this one happen to me. No idea currently.
** allow errors & adjacent errors considered the same error?: github user lalopmak
Only relevant for some "allow errors" mode? Not a big fan of "allow
errors" mode and it's hard to implement correctly.
** DONE possibility to run amphetype on USB stick (use data dir storage) (personal email suggestion from DreymaR)
** handle space more flexibly: option for squeezing space in target text and squeezing space in input
* Newer ideas
** DONE Pip package / upload to PyPi
** Locale support? Switching locales.

Minor feature because would really only affect number conversion and formatting and such.
** TODO make & use CHANGELOG
** TODO Make main text visually change color as you type it
* Blue Sky
** make python package sane (QT / initialization on import)
** TODO clean up all code and make style/naming/filename consistent (have been replacing piecemeal)
